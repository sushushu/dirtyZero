# How can I respring after I apply the changes?
There are 2 methods to manually respring your device. Method 1 is the most reliable, use it if you can.

**Method 1: Use fancy respring app**
1. Install [respringapp.ipa](https://github.com/jailbreakdotparty/dirtyZero/releases/download/respringapp/respringapp.ipa).
2. Try to open the app from the Home Screen.
3. You should get an instant respring ðŸ”¥.

*This method brought to you by [`@nyaathea`](https://x.com/nyaathea). Due to the nature of the method, it is not possible to integrate this directly into the dirtyZero app, hence the seperate IPA.*

**Method 2: Display & Text Size**
1. Before applying the tweaks, go into Settings > Display & Brightness > Display Zoom
2. Pick the option that's opposite of the one you're currently using.
3. After, apply the tweaks.
4. Go back into Settings > Display & Brightness > Display Zoom
5. Pick the option that's opposite of the one you're currently using.
